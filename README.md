`tame-gcs` is a crate with a limited set of [Google Cloud Storage(GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) operations that follows the [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) approach.

## Why?

* You want to control how you actually make HTTP requests against GCS.

## Why not?

* This crate only supports some operations.
* There are several other GCS crates available that have many more features and are easier
to work with, if you don't care about what HTTP clients they use.
* This crate requires more boilerplate to work with.

## Examples

Coming soon, I promise!
