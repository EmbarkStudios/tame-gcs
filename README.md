`tame-gcs` is a crate with a limited set of [Google Cloud Storage(GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) operations that follows the [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) approach.

## Why?

* You want to control how you actually make HTTP requests against GCS.

## Why not?

* This crate only supports some operations.
* There are several other GCS crates available that have many more features and are easier
to work with, if you don't care about what HTTP clients they use.
* This crate requires more boilerplate to work with.

## Examples

The examples directory includes a simplified version of [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil). This
is a work in progress that gives examples of using the different operations that are currently supported in this crate.

* [cat](examples/gsutil/cat.rs) - Shows an example [Object::download](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.download)
* [cp](examples/gsutil/cp.rs) - Shows an example of [Object::download](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.download) as well as [Object::insert_multipart](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.insert_multipart)
* [ls](examples/gsutil/ls.rs) - Shows an example of [Object::list](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.list)
* [signurl](examples/gsutil/signurl.rs) - Shows an example of [UrlSigner](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/signed_url/struct.UrlSigner.html)
* [stat](examples/gsutil/stat.rs) - Shows an example of [Object::get](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.get)
